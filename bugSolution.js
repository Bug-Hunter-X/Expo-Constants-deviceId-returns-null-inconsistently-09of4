In this example, we'll check for a null value and generate a UUID if necessary.

```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const getDeviceId = async () => {
  const deviceId = Constants.deviceId;
  if (deviceId) {
    return deviceId;
  } else {
    // Generate a UUID if deviceId is null
    const uuid = uuidv4();
    // Store this UUID for future use (e.g., AsyncStorage)
    // ... your UUID storage logic ...
    return uuid;
  }
};

// Example usage:
getDeviceId().then(id => {
  console.log('Device ID:', id);
});
```

This solution ensures that an ID is always available, but it's crucial to acknowledge the trade-offs involved.  The generated UUID lacks the guarantees of a system-provided identifier and might introduce additional complexities in managing unique user identification.
