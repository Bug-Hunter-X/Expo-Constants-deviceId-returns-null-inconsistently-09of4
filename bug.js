This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API to obtain the device ID.  In some cases, it returns `null` unexpectedly, even when the device is correctly configured and the app has the necessary permissions. This makes it difficult to uniquely identify devices for features that require unique identifiers, like user authentication or analytics tracking. The inconsistency in returned values makes the app less reliable.
